Standard Introduction:
I have learned over the years that the biggest roadblock to learning industries, trades, skills, anything really, is a lack of real, genuine knowledge and guidance in the subject field.  All industries, all hobbyists, artists, scientists, theologians, EVERYONE, resources guards and creates paywalls to knowledge as if you're trying to join a cult - I have done the sweat and blood sacrifice in all these spellbook fields to show you EXACTLY what you need to study and learn and what to avoid, so you can QUICKLY become proficient and achieve mastery without wasting months or years and hundreds of hours siphoning through garbage.

This is level 1 spells to trading -  You will need the following:
Pencil / Paper / EXCEL & WORD / Charting Software / Time & Patience

I have created these spellbooks to save you possible YEARS in waste time learning to trade and earn money in the market.
